* Come and join us at the `MDP sprint <http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/mdp-toolkit/index.php?title=MDP_Sprint_2010>`_!

==========

*   Several new classifier nodes have been added.
*   A new node extension mechanism makes it possible to dynamically add
    methods or attributes for specific features to node classes, enabling
    aspect-oriented programming in MDP. Several MDP features (like
    parallelization) are now based on this mechanism, and users can add their
    own custom node extensions.
*   BiMDP is a large new package in MDP that introduces bidirectional
    data flows to MDP, including backpropagation and even loops. BiMDP also
    enables the transportation of additional data in flows via messages.
*   BiMDP includes a new flow inspection tool, that runs as as a
    graphical debugger in the webrowser to step through complex flows. It can
    be extended by users for the analysis and visualization of intermediate
    data.
*   As usual, tons of bug fixes
