==========
* MDP 2.6 released!!!!!!
	* Several new classifier nodes have been added
	* A new node extension mechanism makes it possible to dynamically add methods or attributes for specific features to node classes, enabling aspect-oriented programming in MDP. Several MDP features (like parallelization) are now based on this mechanism, and users can add their own cuts node extensions.
	* BiMDP is a large new package in MDP that introduces bidirectional data flows to MDP, including backpropagation and even loops. BiMDP also enables the transportation of additional data in flows via messages.
