Here are some examples on how to use MDP for typical machine learning
applications:
   
* :ref:`examples_logmap` - Using Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) for
  processing a non-stationary time series, derived by a logistic map.
* :ref:`examples_gng` - Capture the topological structure of a
  data distribution.
* :ref:`examples_lle` - Approximate data with a low-dimensional surface
  and reduces its dimensionality by learning a mapping to the surface.
  
The following examples use and illustrate BiMDP:

* :ref:`examples_mlpbackprop` - Implement backpropagation for a multi layer
  perceptron.
* :ref:`examples_graddescent` - Use Newton's method for gradient descent
  with the gradient extension.
