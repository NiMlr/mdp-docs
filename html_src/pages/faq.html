<li ID="FAQ1"> <span class="faqquest">Why was MDP first release numbered 0.9.0?</span>
     <div class="faqansw">

       <span class="soft">MDP</span> has been privately developed in
       the context of computational neuroscience research for some
       time. When we felt that the library was useful and robust
       enough to face a larger audience, we put <span
       class="soft">MDP</span> into the public domain. At this point a
       version number had to be fixed, and we chose 0.9.0 because this
       number conveys the idea of being in development status although
       stable enough to be considered in production status.

<li ID="FAQ2"> <span class="faqquest">Which Python numerical extension
should I install: Numeric, Numarray, or SciPy?</span>

     <DIV class="faqansw">

	 As of version 1.1.0, <span class="soft">MDP</span> supports the
	 most popular numerical extensions to the Python library: 
	 <a href="http://numeric.scipy.org/">Numeric</a>, 
     <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray">Numarray</a>,
     and <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>.

	 In our experience with <span class="soft">MDP</span>, Numarray is the
	 slowest one by a factor of five. Numeric is pretty fast but lacks
	 many of the advanced features that can be found in SciPy. We
	 recommend to install SciPy to achieve the top performance. For
	 intensive scientific applications you should install a complete
	 LAPACK library with ATLAS optimization (see <a href="#FAQ3">this
	 FAQ</a> for more info). You will also be able to install 
         <code class="pycode">symeig</code>, which boosts MDP's speed.

	   If you have a GNU/Linux system we can tell you how we managed
       to do it, even without root password. If you have a Windows
       system, you should install <a
       href="http://www.enthought.com/downloads/downloads.htm#download">
       Python Enthought Edition</a>. It contains Python 2.3, SciPy and
       a lot of other useful stuff. In addition, it has a nice
       installer. On top of this, you can easily install <span class="soft">MDP</span>.
	   If you have a MacOS system, you should try the 
	   <a href="http://download.enthought.com/MacEnthon/ReadMe.html">
       MacEnthon</a> Python edition: it
       already contains <span class="soft">MDP</span>, together with
       tens of other useful packages.

	   <li> Choose a directory to be used as base directory for the
            installation of Python and related software. Of course you
            must have write access on it. We'll call it
            <code>/mydir/</code> in the following.

        <li> <a href="http://www.python.org/download/">Get</a> the
			latest Python release source tarball and install it
			configuring the installation path:<BR> <code
			class="pycode">configure --prefix=/mydir/</code><BR> Make
			sure to put <code>/mydir/bin</code> as first entry in your
			PATH, if you use the <a
			href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html">
			BASH</a> shell this is done for example by:<br> <code
			class="pycode">export PATH="/mydir:$PATH"</code>

			 Link the full LAPACK library with your optimized ATLAS as
             explained in this paragraph from the 
             <a href="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/errata.html#completelp">ATLAS 
             FAQ</a>:
                                
             <DIV class="faqcit">ATLAS does not provide a full
             LAPACK library. However, there is a simple way to get
             ATLAS to provide its faster LAPACK routines to a full
             LAPACK library. ATLAS's internal routines are distinct
             from LAPACK's, so it is safe to compile ATLAS's LAPACK
             routines directly into a netlib-style LAPACK library.
             First, download and install the standard LAPACK library
             from the LAPACK homepage. Then, in your ATLAS/lib/ARCH
             directory (where you should have a liblapack.a), issue
             the following commands:</DIV>

             <code class="pycode">mkdir tmp</code><br>
             <code class="pycode">cd tmp</code><br>
             <code class="pycode">ar x ../liblapack.a</code><br>
             <code class="pycode">cp your_LAPACK_path_&_lib ../liblapack.a</code><br>
             <code class="pycode">ar r ../liblapack.a *.o</code><br>
             <code class="pycode">cd ..</code><br>
             <code class="pycode">rm -rf tmp</code><br>
			 <DIV class="faqcit">
             Just linking in ATLAS's liblapack.a first will not get
             you the best LAPACK performance, mainly because LAPACK's
             untuned ILAENV will be used instead of ATLAS's tuned
             one. So, if you use any LAPACK routine that is not
             provided by ATLAS, it is essential that you create this
             hybrid LAPACK/ATLAS library in order to get the best
             performance.
			 </DIV>

	   <li>  <B>Optional step (for maximum speed)</B>

		    <BR>
			Now you can install your hybrid LAPACK/ATLAS library:<br>

			<code class="pycode">cp include/{cblas.h,clapack.h} /mydir/lib/atlas</code><br> 
			<code class="pycode">cp lib/Linux_XXX/*.a /mydir/lib/atlas</code><br>
            <code class="pycode">export ATLAS=/mydir/lib/atlas</code><br>

       <li> Choose which numerical extension to Python you want to install. As of version 1.1.0 
            <span class="soft">MDP</span> fully supports
			<a href="http://numeric.scipy.org/">Numeric</a>, 
            <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/numarray">Numarray</a>,
            and <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>.
			
			See also <a href="#FAQ2">this FAQ</a>.  Get the latest
            available release of the numeric extension, unpack the
            source and configure the installation:

			<dl>
			<dt><span class="soft">Numeric</span> 

			    <dd> If you have installed a complete LAPACK with ATLAS optimizations,
			    you can tell the installer that you want Numeric to be
			    compiled using your own ATLAS/LAPACK. Customize the
			    installation setting the following variables in the
			    file <code>customize.py</code>:<br>

                <code class="pycode">use_system_lapack = 1</code><br> 
				<code class="pycode">lapack_library_dirs = ['/mydir/lib/atlas']</code><br> 
				<code class="pycode">lapack_libraries=['lapack','cblas','f77blas','atlas','g2c']</code><br> 
				<code class="pycode">use_dotblas = 1</code><br>
				<code class="pycode">dotblas_include_dirs = ['/mydir/lib/atlas']</code><br>

                Now you can compile and install:<BR>

                <code class="pycode">python setup.py install</code><br>

			<dt><span class="soft">Numarray</span>
                                    
				<dd> There must be a way to tell the installer that
                you want Numarray to be compiled using your own
                ATLAS/LAPACK, but unfortunately it's not documented
                anywhere. To perform a default installation:<BR>

                <code class="pycode">python setup.py config install --gencode</code><br> 
                                

			<dt><span class="soft">SciPy</span>

                <dd> Before installing SciPy, we strongly suggest to
                install <a href="http://cens.ioc.ee/projects/f2py2e/">
                F2PY</a> (Fortran to Python Interface Generator). With
                this you will be able to generate extension modules
                for Python using good old libraries written in FORTRAN
                and C. You will also be able to install <a
                href="symeig.html">symeig</a>,
				which boosts <span class="soft">MDP</span>'s speed.

				<BR>
				<a href="http://cens.ioc.ee/projects/f2py2e/2.x/F2PY-2-latest.tar.gz">
                Get</a> and install F2PY:<BR>

                <code class="pycode">python setup.py install</code><br>

                <a href="http://www.scipy.org/download/">Get</a> the latest SciPy release.
                For installation you can follow <a href="http://www.scipy.org/documentation/buildscipy.txt">
                these</a> instructions and read the file <code>INSTALL.txt</code> in the source tarball. 
                If you compiled your own LAPACK/ATLAS then compilation is really
                easy. Set the enviromental variable <code>ATLAS</code> to match <code>/mydir/lib/atlas</code>:<br>

                <code class="pycode">export ATLAS="/mydir/lib/atlas"</code><br> 

                followed by the usual:<br>

				<code class="pycode">python setup.py install</code><br>

                Verify your SciPy installation. See the output of:<br>

                <code class="pycode">python /mydir/pythonX.X/site-packages/scipy_core/scipy_distutils/system_info.py</code><br>
                
				and check that your ATLAS and LAPACK library have been
                detected.<br> You should also run all available SciPy
                tests in a Python shell:
<pre class="literal-block">
&gt;&gt;&gt; import scipy
&gt;&gt;&gt; scipy.test(level=10)
</pre>
            </dl>
