Why was MDP first release numbered 0.9.0?
=========================================

MDP has been privately developed in the context of computational
neuroscience research for some time. When we felt that the library was
useful and robust enough to face a larger audience, we put MDP into
the public domain. At this point a version number had to be fixed, and
we chose 0.9.0 because this number conveys the idea of being in
development status although stable enough to be considered in
production status.
