     MDP 3.5 released! This is a bug-fix release

     Note that from this release MDP is in maintenance mode. 13 years after its first public release,
     MDP has reached full maturity and no new features are planned in the future.

     If you plan to do serious machine learning in Python, use `sklearn <http://scikit-learn.org>`_.
     Note though that some algorithms, notably SFA and Growing Neural Gas, are only available in MDP.
     We would be happy to support the porting of these algorithms to sklearn! 

     MDP works equally well in Python 2 and Python 3. All code examples in the documentation are using
     Python 2 though.
